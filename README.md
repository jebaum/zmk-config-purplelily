i have some idea what i'm doing

update the config file in here. push to github and through the power of belief and friendship, it will build the firmware file. plug in the keyboard. press the button thing on the keyboard twice to make it mount as a usb drive. it will show up under `/VOLUMES`. copy the firmware onto the thing. it'll crash because the keyboard gets the new firmware and does some reset thingy. this is fine for some reason. then repeat with the other keyboard half. good lord.
